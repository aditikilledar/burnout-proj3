# Technical Overview

This application is a React-based web application that runs in the user's web browser. It provides the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Upon logging in, the application creates and stores tokens locally on the user's machine to maintain user sessions securely.

- **Access Control**: Authenticated users have access to multiple pages and features within the application, ensuring a personalized and controlled user experience.

- **Backend Server**: The application relies on a Flask server to serve various user requests. The server interacts with a MongoDB database to fetch and store data as needed, ensuring smooth functionality and data persistence.

With these components working together, the application delivers a secure and feature-rich experience to its users.

 # Getting started
 
Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows)
 
 Step 1: 
  Git Clone the Repository 
  
    git clone https://github.com/aditikilledar/burnout-proj3

Step 2:
   Ensure mongodb is running and execute the below to populate the tables:
   Navigate to the backend folder.

    cd backend

  Once in the backend, run:
  
    python insert_event_data.py
    python insert_food_data.py

 Step 3:
   Remain in the backend folder and run the following command to start the server:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask run

 Step 4:
   Navigate to the frontend folder and run the below to start the React app:
    
    cd frontend
    npm install 
    npm start
    
 Step 5:
    Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Common Installation Problems and Their Fixes

### Proxy error
Go to the file called `package.json` and change the value for "proxy" to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/".

### Sign In Error
If you do not already have an account, please sign up on our website.

If you have already signed up perviously, check if your MongoDB server is running. If not, please start and connect to the local server and try again.
